## Welcome to Mickie's Blog

I started my journey with Microsoft like many of you; using Word, Excel, Publisher, etc. but one day at work I noticed there was a program installed on my machine that I was unfamiliar with and that program was called SharePoint. From this point on I found a solution to share files with collegues across the US, because we did not have network drives. Since then I have grown my skills in almost all the on-prem versions of SharePoint, and now into Microsoft 365.
